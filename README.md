# Tic Tac Toe!!!

## About

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses is normally a game you play with
a friend (or by yourself) on a 3x3 grid made on paper with a pencil.  In this
rendition, you can play online with your friend right next to you taking turns!
Although, the opitmal strategy to aim for a tie has probably already been
discovered, it's still a nice way to pass time and keep you sharp!

## Planning

My idea for the design was to have a 3x3 grid with none of the borders hidden.
One of the end goals for this project was to have the "X & O" makrers replaced
by images of X and Zero, from the Megaman series.

I first thought this out through my Notes application on my phone.  That
consisted of figuring out what was needed for the game, such as a grid, markers
for the grid, players, turns, win/draw conditions, etc.  The game concepts were
first thought out as bullet points, but then turned to pseudo-code and then
became the official logic on my editor.

## Wireframe

Below you'll find the original wireframe for the project.  The final product
definitely deviated from the initial layout, due to time crunches, but you can
see the grid has kept its design.

## User Stories

The following user stories, helped develop and contributed to the game logic and
features of my site:

1. As a User, I'd like to be able to create an account, if I do not have one
2. As a User, I would want to sign in and have access to new games
3. As a User, I'd like to be able to play as if I have someone by my side (or as if I'm going against myself)
4. As a User, I'd like some notification for invalid/illegal moves
5. As a User, I'd like some notification informing me when I win, lose, or draw
6. As a User, I'd like to be able to start a new game after a game is finished
7. As a User, I'd like to have access to my statistics, whether it be total games, wins or losses
8. As a User, I would want to be able to sign out with all my information still stored somewhere

## Future Iterations

I would like for future iterations to have a layout more similar to the
wireframe I had in mind in the beginning. I'll stay with the total games stat,
but I'd also like to add functionality to keep score of the wins/losses/draws
between the players for that sign-in session. Lastly, I would like to style the
site and add more Megaman-esq elements to the layout.
